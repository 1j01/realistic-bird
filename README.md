Realistic Bird
==============

A [#flappyjam](http://itch.io/jam/flappyjam) game.

Todo
----
* Title screen!
* Single bounce safety? (It didn't work right away, so I moved on to other things; I still want to try this)
* Save best score to localStorage (Note: don't save in AI mode or until game restart)
* Retro screen effect (Hmm, the effect I made previously doesn't scale well up to even the small resolution of 640x480)
* Expose AI mode option (Currently you can try it [here#ai](http://isaiahodhner.ml/realistic-bird/#ai), and... [here#ai+lol](http://isaiahodhner.ml/realistic-bird/#ai+lol))
